# project-landing-page

2nd iteration of doing this project, around 2-3 years apart. I feel like this 2nd time round was much better, easier, and I made stronger and more practical use of flexbox compared to the first time. This is part of my 'refresher' for web dev.

The 1st iteration relied on heavy usage of padding and margin adjustment to make the layout, even though it is almost identical to the 2nd iteration but it is using flexbox instead to greater effect.
